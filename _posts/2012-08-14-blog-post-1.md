Debates about personal data and online privacy often make assumptions about parents’ digital skills and sharing practices, how they view their children’s online privacy, and whether parents have the skills to translate concerns about privacy into practical action. This report, the third in a series, is based on a nationally representative survey of 2032 UK parents of children aged 0-17 years old. We examine how UK parents view their own and their children’s digital privacy, whether and how they share images of their children online, and how they negotiate new norms about parents’ roles in supporting their child’s safety and fostering their independence online.</small>
