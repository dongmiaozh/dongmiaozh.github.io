title: "Who benefits from AI adoption? Skill complementarity and labour market dynamics"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Recent studies on artificial intelligence (AI) and labour market outcomes often focus on the automation effects of AI. However, which skills might complement AI technologies and how AI adoption shapes employment and wage dynamics remain under-explored at the occupation level. Moving beyond the classic measurement of skills such as education, tenure or specific skill categories, I assess how many skills are combined in an occupation and their respective complexity. I refer to this as "complexity intelligence" and propose that occupations with high complexity intelligence will complement AI technologies. Most notably, the findings show that complex occupations are more likely to adopt AI technologies. In addition, there is a positive correlation between AI adoption and employment growth. AI adoption is associated with an increase in wage growth on average, with a larger increase for complex occupations.'

Recent studies on artificial intelligence (AI) and labour market outcomes often focus on the automation effects of AI. However, which skills might complement AI technologies and how AI adoption shapes employment and wage dynamics remain under-explored at the occupation level. Moving beyond the classic measurement of skills such as education, tenure or specific skill categories, I assess how many skills are combined in an occupation and their respective complexity. I refer to this as "complexity intelligence" and propose that occupations with high complexity intelligence will complement AI technologies. Most notably, the findings show that complex occupations are more likely to adopt AI technologies. In addition, there is a positive correlation between AI adoption and employment growth. AI adoption is associated with an increase in wage growth on average, with a larger increase for complex occupations.
