excerpt: 'The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the labour market is one of the paramount challenges of our time. Although this subject has undoubtedly garnered significant attention, most studies are conducted at the national scale and ignore heterogeneous impacts across regions. This paper adopts an explicit geographical perspective to assess the creative destruction of AI on occupations. We develop a Spatial AI Occupation Index to explore how a region's entry into AI technologies - i.e. the development of new specializations in AI - relates to the changes in employment at the occupational level. We find that the entry of AI technologies is associated with an increase in employment for occupations that possess a high potential for augmentation by AI. On the other hand, employment for routine-intensive occupations tends to decline. We also find evidence that AI may lead to shifting occupational specialization of regions: high AI-intensive MSAs are increasingly specialized in non-routine occupations that require creativity and interpersonal skills. This indicates that AI-intensive regions are likely to be more resilient and prosper from the AI transition, while regions that specialize in routine occupations are at risk of losing out.'
