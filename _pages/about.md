Hi! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Block Center for Technology and Society, Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University.

Before joining CMU, I was a Marie Curie research fellow for the [POLISS](https://poliss.eu/) project and a 
PhD candidate at Utrecht University in the Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning. I was fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof Ron Boschma, Pierre Alex Balland and Andrea Morrison. I graduated with a Master's in Public Administration from the London School of Economics and Political Science, specialising in Public and Economic Policy. 

Broadly speaking, I'm keen to understand how we can leverage AI to maximize human potential and deliver inclusive and equitable growth. My PhD thesis looks into how complementarity might shape AI's impact on the labour market. I use a combination of econometric methods, network science, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to study the topic. Using administrative data, AI patent and adoption data in the Netherlands and the U.S., the findings show that workers and regions with complementary skills to AI are more likely to benefit from its progress, while others are at risk of losing out. 

While more discussions are steering towards harnessing human-AI complementarity, less is known about which skills are complementary to AI. In my job market paper, I conceptualized "complexity intelligence" as a potential candidate. Rather than just looking at education, tenure, or speficif skill categories, we could view skills as bundles. "Complexity intelligence" captures how many skills are combined within an occupation and their aggregate complexity. I find that occupations with high-complexity intelligence are more likely to adopt AI technologies. In addition, AI adoption is associated with an increase in wage growth on average, with a larger increase for complex occupations. This research was nominated for the 2024 DRUID Steven Klepper Award for Best Young Scholar Paper.

I believe one of the best ways for a scholar to understand the world is to engage with people of different backgrounds. I have benefited greately from my academic visits (formal and informal ones) to INGENIO (CSIC-UPV), ETH, MIT, Harvard and Bocconi. I have advised high-level policymakers on digitalization strategies (Utrecht Province), skill development (UNDP) and gender equality (EBRD).
