Hi! I am a Marie Curie research fellow for the [POLISS](https://poliss.eu/) project and a 
PhD candidate at Utrecht University in the Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning. I was fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof Ron Boschma, Pierre Alex Balland and Andrea Morrison. I graduated with a Master's in Public Administration from the London School of Economics and Political Science, specialising in Public and Economic Policy. 

Broadly speaking, I'm keen to understand how we can leverage AI to maximize human potential and deliver inclusive and equitable growth. My PhD thesis looks into how complementarity might shape AI's impact on the labour market. I use a combination of econometric methods, network science, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to study the topic. Using administrative data, AI patent and adoption data in the Netherlands and the U.S., I show that workers and regions with complementary skills to AI are more likely to benefit from its progress, while others are at risk of losing out. 

So what skill is complementary to AI? In my job market paper, I introduced the concept of "complexity intelligence" as a potential candidate. Instead of focusing on education, job experience, or narrowly defined skill categories, I suggest that we view skills as bundles. "Complexity intelligence" measures how many skills are combined within an occupation and their overall complexity. My findings show that occupations with high-complexity intelligence are more likely to adopt AI technologies. In addition, AI adoption is associated with an increase in wage growth on average, with a larger increase for complex occupations. This research was nominated for the 2024 DRUID Steven Klepper Award for Best Young Scholar Paper.

I believe the best way for a scholar to understand the world is to interact with people of different backgrounds. I have benefited greately from my academic and non-academic visit across the world. I have also advised high-level policymakers on digitalization strategies (Utrecht Province), skill development (UNDP) and gender equality (EBRD). 

I am on the job market this year! I'm open to tenure-track faculty positions, post-doc fellowships or relevant industry roles. Please get in touch!
